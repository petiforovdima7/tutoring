                      <p>The key challenge for AP Language and Composition, is to extract key information from the passage quickly, understand it, and apply to the multiple choice questions.  Students need to look deeper into the text, to understand other elements such as author’s intent, tonality and literary devices, which are key to answer the multiple choice questions.</p>
                      <p>The second challenge is typical to multiple choice exams:  some choices are very similar and they are both correct answers - just one choice is “more correct.”.  The student will need to deal with ambiguity to make judgment calls.</p>

              <p>When reading a short story, novel or any English text move from the interpretation and understanding of a story to looking for the elements of a story. This can be done by looking at the major events in the English text and connecting them back to developing themes that you see are reoccurring. For example, if a character acts a certain way more than once, question the reason for it and how it affects the overall theme. Questioning when reading is important as it motivates you to critically think why a certain event has happened, why the character has acted a particular way and how does this all reflect the theme of the story.&nbsp;</p>
              <p>Another key strategy is to be a proactive reader.&nbsp; To be a proactive does not simply mean to read the text, but to be aware of unfamiliar vocabulary, marking major events and being able to summarize.&nbsp; Also, do not hesitate to reread when needed as your understanding and overall comprehension can change for the better the second time.</p>

              <p>To improve your writing skills in English it is important to understand that teachers look for clarity, flow and effective communication. To assist your flow when essay writing use effective transition words such as: additionally, furthermore, overall, in addition, etc… An English essay that flows is important as it shows your English writing skills and sentence formulation. Each sentence should lead to the next for better communication of ideas, points and arguments. </p>
              <p>Before starting an English essay it is essential for you to plan and draft your ideas and thoughts in an outline. Outlines and graphic organizers are always helpful for visioning the construction of your arguments and making sure you are conveying your points clearly. Also, make sure you have well researched your standpoint before starting an English essay. Researching and gathering evidence improves your writing ability when creating points and developing your thesis. </p>
              <p>Be aware of your writing style and ways you can improve issues such as: run-on sentences, language, differences in points, and clichés. Knowing your strengths in writing is important; however realizing your weaknesses is critical. A good writer is proactive in improving and learning to be a better writer.</p>

              <p>When reading always question and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses in characters, the author and/or the overall text. Comment on the development of characters and the author’s choice of narration and setting. To help think critically ask the following questions: Who is the author and what is their perspective? Who is the targeted audience and how does that influence the way information is presented?&nbsp; What is the moral or main message of the text? Do you agree with the test and why do you agree or disagree? These questions will allow you to dig deeper then just understanding the story but to analyze the certain pieces the author has presented and the purpose of them.</p>

                    <p>If you aren’t performing well in the subject, chances are you have foundation gaps.  The first step is really to address your foundation gaps.  Typically this is about essay writing and critical thinking.  For students in junior high school, it could be sentence structures and grammar (such as run on sentences).  Our English tutors in Bellevue, WA, do provide lessons on essay writing and if needed, on sentence structures.  It is important to learn the basics and build a strong foundation, as you will need your English skills throughout high school (all other subjects and projects) and universities.  You need to avoid the mentality of “getting by”, and focus on mastering these skills for long term.</p>

                    <p>The second advise we give, is to put your 100% effort into this.  It means that reading ahead on your Shakespeare or novels, or spend time analyzing the text.  Our English tutors in Bellevue, WA, will provide you with guidance, and for English your hard work will pay off.</p>

What really make this Academy different is the great attention given to students, they analyse carefully the strength and weakness of their student, they work on clear strategy to improve students performance and are very flexible to change strategy when needed. <span class="wp-more">they worked patiently with my son and improved his performance to excellency. It is great how management and especially Mr. Victor follow up with us on my son progress , I received many phone calls and emails with updates,  this tight follow up and advices we received resulted in huge difference in my son performance and his awareness to his education.

                                <span class="wp-google-text">At a time when school had to be done differently, Queen Elizabeth Academy stepped up to the plate.  During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. <span class="wp-more">At Queensway academy my son has to sign on daily with his teacher and classmates ( small class size only 8 students)  and she actually teaches a class.  There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I can’t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

Megan has had the traditional in class model with QEA and has just finished up with an online platform.  Both have been great and I am confident that Megan is now prepared for university.  I truly believe that the public school system of distance learning cannot do what Victor and his team have done for my daughter.  She has been prepared for success as a direct result of professional teaching methods that work.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

Private credit courses were mainly grade 12 English over the summer and grade 12 math courses throughout the <span class="wp-more">fall semester in the evening. I have heard quite a bit about private credit courses offered by other schools that are not as through and almost too easy for students to get high average. Courses at QEA are well laid out and very extensive to make sure they provide good foundations for post secondary education.   <br>Victor is excellent at communicating with parents and students and he is also very good at listening and acting on everyones feedback. Highly recommend QEA!!</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

We'd heard great things about Victor and the Queen Elizabeth Academy from friends who had <span class="wp-more">kids take fast track classes.  The low student to teacher ratio and the extra 1:1 care they provide really helps bring out the engagement compared to a 33 student class.  My son has greatly enjoyed the course--though summer classes are intense and fast paced.  All the more reason for extra attention during instruction.  We would recommend Victor and his team of instructors for any of the accredited high school programs they are offering.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

We found the teacher in her high school did not <span class="wp-more">care, nor take time to ensure they understood. Tests covered content that was not taught in class. Her experience was a disaster! Given this we put put her back to QE  to upgrade her mark too prepareand ensure she had background for university.  Not only have we seen a 15-20% bump in mark but we have seen her confidence soar because the teacher teaches the content, ensures they understand and truly cares during covid- yes online has been fantastic! Money well spent and calc.will be with QE since public education in math is failing miserably. Big shout to QE and their fantastic teachers!</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

Victor reassured us that this won’t be the case with his school. I have to admit quality of learning is outstanding teachers are very passionate and caring. They make sure that each kid in the class understand the unit. The classes are so well organized online and they flow smoothly. We are very glad we signed up for the summer school wit QEA.
