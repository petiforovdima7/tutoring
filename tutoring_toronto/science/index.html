								<p>It is important to build a good foundation for Science, for our students in Toronto.</p>
								
                                <p>QEA Science (7-8) program aims to prepare your child for high school level science.  We teach grade 9 level science curriculum in an easy to understand, elementary level. This will build a good foundation for your child, and at the same time, stimulate their curiosity and interests.</p>

                                <p>The key to success in science, is to understand the concept.  This means asking the “why” behind the concept.  In our chemistry lesson, for example, we will start with an atom, then molecules and then explain to our students how chemical reaction occurs vs. physical change, and how to determine which atom will combine with whom based on the octet theory.  What does it look like when an atom combines with other atoms in a molecular form.</p>

                                <p>Science is always a challenge for students in Toronto.</p>

								<p>In our elementary science program, we cover chemistry, electricity, ecology and space.  These are the topics that your child will learn in grade 9.</p>

								<p>It’s important to get tutoring support in Science in Toronto.</p>

During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. <span

There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I can’t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.</span><span

I have heard quite a bit about private credit courses offered by other schools that are not as through and almost too easy for students to get high average. Courses at QEA are well laid out and very extensive to make sure they provide good foundations for post secondary education.   <br>Victor is excellent at communicating with parents and students and he is also very good at listening and acting on everyones feedback. Highly recommend QEA!!</span><span

My son has greatly enjoyed the course--though summer classes are intense and fast paced.  All the more reason for extra attention during instruction.

Given this we put put her back to QE  to upgrade her mark too prepareand ensure she had background for university.  Not only have we seen a 15-20% bump in mark but we have seen her confidence soar because the teacher teaches the content, ensures they understand and truly cares during covid- yes online has been fantastic! Money well spent and calc.will be with QE since public education in math is failing miserably. Big shout to QE and their fantastic teachers!</span><span

Victor reassured us that this won’t be the case with his school. I have to admit quality of learning is outstanding teachers are very passionate and caring. They make sure that each kid in the class understand the unit. The classes are so well organized online and they flow smoothly. We are very glad we signed up for the summer school wit QEA. Most likely we will pursue some other classes in the fall due to uncertainty of regular classes.<br><br>Marija</span><span
