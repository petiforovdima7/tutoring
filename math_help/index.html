What really make this Academy different is the great attention given to students, they analyse carefully the strength and weakness of their student, they work on clear strategy to improve students performance and are very flexible to change strategy when needed. <span class="wp-more">they worked patiently with my son and improved his performance to excellency. It is great how management and especially Mr. Victor follow up with us on my son progress , I received many phone calls and emails with updates,  this tight follow up and advices we received resulted in huge difference in my son performance and his awareness to his education. I highly recommend QEA.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

                                <span class="wp-google-text">At a time when school had to be done differently, Queen Elizabeth Academy stepped up to the plate.  During the initial change  of school due to Covid my son was going to a public ally funded school and the most contact he had with his teachers was to read or watch something on-line and then do an assignment which he got a grade back but no feedback on what he did right or wrong. <span class="wp-more">At Queensway academy my son has to sign on daily with his teacher and classmates ( small class size only 8 students)  and she actually teaches a class.  There is plenty of time for questions and my son gets feedback on his tests. Being at work I canâ€™t monitor if my son actually signs on but there is great communication from the school. One day my son slept in and I got text and emails asking where my son was.  They follow up quickly if you have any questions or concerns.  I highly recommend attending here.  Great learning happens here.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

She is registered for physics 12 in the fall.  Due to the pandemic situation we have been very worried that our child is not going to get the foundations in math and science that she needs. <span class="wp-more">Thanks to Victor and his team of highly qualified teachers our concerns have been alleviated.  Megan has had the traditional in class model with QEA and has just finished up with an online platform.  Both have been great and I am confident that Megan is now prepared for university.  I truly believe that the public school system of distance learning cannot do what Victor and his team have done for my daughter.

Private credit courses were mainly grade 12 English over the summer and grade 12 math courses throughout the <span class="wp-more">fall semester in the evening. I have heard quite a bit about private credit courses offered by other schools that are not as through and almost too easy for students to get high average. Courses at QEA are well laid out and very extensive to make sure they provide good foundations for post secondary education.   <br>Victor is excellent at communicating with parents and students and he is also very good at listening and acting on everyones feedback. Highly recommend QEA!!</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

                                <span class="wp-google-text">With the Peel school board in a bit of a mess this year, we were looking for a credited summer program for my son to fast track his Grade 11 math.  We'd heard great things about Victor and the Queen Elizabeth Academy from friends who had <span class="wp-more">kids take fast track classes.  The low student to teacher ratio and the extra 1:1 care they provide really helps bring out the engagement compared to a 33 student class.  My son has greatly enjoyed the course--though summer classes are intense and fast paced.  All the more reason for extra attention during instruction.  We would recommend Victor and his team of instructors for any of the accredited high school programs they are offering.</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

This year she took Gr 12 functions at school and she found it was difficult and confusing, as well, the teacher did not teach ALL the material. We found the teacher in her high school did not <span class="wp-more">care, nor take time to ensure they understood. Tests covered content that was not taught in class. Her experience was a disaster! Given this we put put her back to QE  to upgrade her mark too prepareand ensure she had background for university.  Not only have we seen a 15-20% bump in mark but we have seen her confidence soar because the teacher teaches the content, ensures they understand and truly cares during covid- yes online has been fantastic! Money well spent and calc.will be with QE since public education in math is failing miserably. Big shout to QE and their fantastic teachers!</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>

Thank you all<br/><br/>Marija<br><br>Update on July 25.<br><br>This summer we were very hesitant about online lessons since we had bad experience with our regular high school distance learning. Victor reassured us that this wonâ€™t be the case with his school. I have to admit quality of learning is outstanding teachers are very passionate and caring. They make sure that each kid in the class understand the unit. The classes are so well organized online and they flow smoothly. We are very glad we signed up for the summer school wit QEA. Most likely we will pursue some other classes in the fall due to uncertainty of regular classes.<br><br>Marija</span><span class="wp-more-toggle">read more</span></span></div>
